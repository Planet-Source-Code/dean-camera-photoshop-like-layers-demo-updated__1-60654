### Description

This is a small demonstration showing you how to implement dynamic Photoshop-like graphics layers in VB (including alpha-blending). By this, I mean this demo shows you how to create code that will enable you to add, manipulate and move each individual layer at runtime while using a small amount of memory for each layer.

This sample uses intermediate code; i.e. no subclassing etc., only GDI API functions.

Please see the comments on the demo form for a longer explanation. Votes welcome, comments preferred. UPDATE: Major GDI memory leaks fixed, support for Win98, Layer Delete button and Percentage Alpha values added.
